# FLEXipes

##Problem:
You’re working from home, you have an Imperfect subscription, and you don’t know what to do with some of the food they send you!
Before covid, you loved going out to eat with friends and did not cook from home often. Now you need to develop some skills fast.
You don’t want the food to go to waste but don’t know where to find recipes that have the ingredients you have at hand!
