# FLEXipes

## Problem:
You’re working from home, you have an Imperfect subscription, and you don’t know what to do with some of the food they send you!

Before COVID, you loved going out to eat with friends and did not cook from home often. Now you need to develop some skills fast.

You don’t want the food to go to waste but don’t know where to find recipes that have the ingredients you have at hand!

## Solution:
Using the FLEXipes App, you can input all the ingredients you currently have at home and get a list of recipes that you can make with just those ingredients - no grocery shopping required! 

Any recipes that you want to make, you can add to your “To Make List”.

You can also save your favorite recipes to return to later! Dinner will never be a hassle again! 

## What is FLEXipes?
FLEXipes is a web application that lets you input the ingredients you have in your fridge and hunt for recipes to try based on your list.

You can SAVE recipes from your results to try them out. If you like them you can add them to your Favorites list!

It’s as Easy as that!
